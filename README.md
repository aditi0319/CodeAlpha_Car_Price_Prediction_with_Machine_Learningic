# CodeAlpha_Car_Price_Prediction_with_Machine_Learningic

## Overview
Car price prediction is a valuable tool in the automotive industry, used for determining the market value of a car based on multiple factors. This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning techniques. The price of a car depends on various attributes such as brand reputation, features, horsepower, mileage, and more. By analyzing these factors, our model can provide a fairly accurate estimate of a car's price, assisting buyers, sellers, and other stakeholders.

## Dataset
#### The dataset used in this project contains a wide range of car attributes such as:
* Car Name
* Model year
* Selling Price
* Present_Price
* Driven_kms
* Transmission 
* Owner
This data allows us to understand how different features influence the price, creating a solid foundation for our machine learning model.

## Model
For this project, we used the Linear Regression model (or mention your actual model if different, like Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.). Linear Regression is a commonly used machine learning algorithm for predictive modeling. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we trained this model on a substantial portion of the dataset, then evaluated its performance on test data to ensure accurate predictions.

## Workflow
* Data Collection: Collect data with relevant features that impact car prices.
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale numerical data.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze feature distributions and relationships to better understand the dataset.
* Model Training: Train the chosen machine learning model with training data.
* Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and fine-tune it for improved performance.
* Prediction: Use the trained model to predict car prices based on input features.
